# Asteroids (Raylib)

Simple Asteroid clone in Raylib

This project is a practice on how to use C++ and Raylib to create simple game features and mechanics.

One of the main hurdles in this project was relearning math, geometry, and some physics to replicate the game mechanics in Asteroid.

## To build

1. Make sure to have raylib downloaded.
2. Clone or download repo.
3. Press F5 to run.
